Those of us facilitating have training and practical experience in doing mental health support for other young people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What steps are being taken to safeguard children and young people in this training?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussions around mental distress can bring up difficult memories and emotions. All participants are encouraged to take care of themselves and step back from the training if necessary, and facilitators will support them to do this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants will also be put into buddy groups with each other and young people who work within QueerCare to check in with each other and discuss the training material further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only capacity in which people aged over 19 will be in the training will be as tech support. Everyone aged 18 and over who will be facilitating or doing tech support in this training has a Level 3 Safeguarding qualification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we are concerned about a young person on the call we will take relevant steps to make sure they\u2019re safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Does this course lead to a qualification?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This course does not lead to a formal qualification, but participants will be given a certificate upon completion and will have the skills necessary to do peer support work in their communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why are there reserved spaces?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>QueerCare is an autonomous care organisation, which means we provide support outside of mainstream medical systems, as well as helping people to access those services for support we can\u2019t provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who experience oppression due to lived experience of being psychiatrised and\/or experience of racism and\/or transmisogyny are often systematically excluded from accessing appropriate and supportive mental healthcare from both \u2018mainstream\u2019 and \u2018community\u2019 services. At the same time, those of us in these groups are more likely to experience mental health problems\/mental distress. QueerCare\u2019s work focuses on building communities which can care for themselves. Young people in these groups are often in positions where we are supporting each other through distress informally and without much of a support network&nbsp; &#8211; this training aims to give participants the skills, resources and support to do this work more safely and sustainably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you have further questions or if you would like this information in a different format please email training@queercare.network.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background\" href=\"http:\/\/tiny.cc\/qc-peer-support-sign-up\">Register<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-cyan-bluish-gray-color has-text-color has-small-font-size\">Page Last Updated: 2020\/09\/01<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re excited to announce that we will be running an online Peer Support training course for people aged 13 to 19.
